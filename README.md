# Steps to run App

1. Git Clone
2. npm install
3. npm run
4. http://localhost:4200/home

## Unit Testing

1. npm test


## Technology

1. Angular 6
2. Reactive Form
3. Bootstrap
4. TypeScript

## Additional things which Couldn't be done

1. Could not add the functionality of room photo as it required file-server setup and I do not have the available band-width
to pick that up. To compensate that I have added service tagging to hotel which was less time consuming, and shows the beauty 
of anguar reactive forms.
